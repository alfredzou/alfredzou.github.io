### Introduction

Recently I finished General Assembly's 3-month Data Science Immersive (DSI) course. I would like to take a brief moment to pause and reflect on my journey and my achievements.

### Motivation to take this course

Out of high school, I took a 5 and a half year engineering and commerce degree from UNSW. After graduating, I worked in the engineering industry for nearly 2 years.

I soon realised I wasn't enjoying neither my work nor the industry, and I knew I needed a career change. Coincidentally my friend had previously taken General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive course, which put the data industry on my radar. I realised that I could utilise data analytics to help businesses make well-informed decisions. This appealed to my enjoyment of strategic planning. For these reasons I decided to move into the field of data.

After answering the **why**, I needed to figure out the **how**. There are many options, but the two main ones are a university degree or a boot camp. Data science university degrees take at least 2 years and up to 3. I definitely didn’t want to pursue this route for lots of reasons. I’ve already spent 5 and a half years at university and I wanted to get back into the work force as quick as possible. Another reason is that I felt my university degree was too theoretical and didn’t help much with my engineering job. 

The obvious choice was a boot camp for data. They’re quick, practical but expensive. I could have taken a data analytics boot camp, but I also wanted an introduction to data science as well. Given my friend's positive experience with the boot camp and success in the industry, I choose General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive course.

### Experience at General Assembly DSI course

**Disclaimer**: General Assembly (GA) courses have gone online due to COVID-19 safety concerns, so my experiences may not be a good representation of a future Data Science Immersive course at GA.

The Data Science course can be taken both part-time and full-time at General Assembly. I took the full-time immersive course in the Sydney campus, so I can only comment on that. The course is 3-months long, Monday to Friday and 9am to 5pm. The course costs a hefty $17,500, which is a big financial commitment. Both Sydney and Melbourne classes are taught by one instructor through Zoom, with one local teaching assistant for each class. In my cohort DSI+09, we had 6 students in Sydney and 7 students in Melbourne. My only gripe is that there were microphone issues making it difficult for each class to hear each other.

They’re not joking when they say immersive. It means tell your friends and family that you’ll be unavailable for the next 3 months. The pace of the course is so blazingly fast, it's expected that people fall behind. The best analogy I’ve read, is that GA's immersive courses are like drinking water from a fire hose. The daily schedule involves learning 2 to 4 new topics in a day. On top of that there are 5 projects, and weekly job preparation sessions with homework. This course is definitely not an easy one, if you take it, it’s going to be your whole life for the next 3 months.

My initial attitude of perfectionism or ‘I want to learn everything thoroughly’ quickly lead to ‘I don’t want to fall behind’ (and I did fall behind). The course starts off with python, which was easy for me. This was because before the course had even began, I had already spent at least a month learning python.  However, those not experienced with coding will struggle and even one person from Sydney had pulled out. So, my greatest recommendation is to learn python before you attend the course. I recommend [Socratica’s Python playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6m6_IIN94&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-).

If I recall correctly the first 3 weeks is essentially data analytics through statistics, databases and python to clean and analyse data. Those without a statistical background, like me, will struggle heavily with the statistical side of things. Roughly weeks 4 to 10 will be spent on learning machine learning, which is data science. The final 2 weeks will be spent on working on a machine learning capstone project. I had chosen to do a machine translation project utilising neural networks. This was an extremely difficult project that I did not end up finishing by the end of the course. However, I plan to continue working on it, in the future. I recommend choosing a simpler project that can be completed within the final two weeks to be showcased to employers.

I think the experience at a GA immersive course is make or break by how well you get along with your cohort. My friend had also told me the same thing. My cohort was **AMAZING**, I got along with them so well and I’ve definitely made friends for life. Similarly, my teaching assistant and instructor were also amazing and supportive.

Normally at the end of the course there is meant to be an employer meet and greet. The meet and greet is like a career fair where GA graduates showcase their capstone projects to prospective employers. However, this ended up being cancelled due to COVID-19 safety concerns.

### After graduating, what now?

After three months, I didn’t magically turn into a data scientist. Given the pace of the course and the limited time, I instead gained a high-level overview of both data analytics and science. This is especially true due to how vast and complicated data science is. My instructor had done what he had promised, he had brought me to the edge of data science. To me this high-level overview is extremely important, it has given me direction on what to self-study. The common consensus within my cohort was that we all had knowledge gaps. Now it is essentially up to our own effort to fill these. Ultimately, these things come with time and professional experience. There are many cool things during the course that I haven't fully grasped, and now I'm looking forward to deep dive into them.

Currently I am preparing for a junior data analytics role, which is what most graduates become after the course. This requires key important skills in data visualisation and SQL, which I have knowledge gaps in. Recently I made a COVID-19 dashboard in Tableau, which has helped improve my data visualisation abilities. This week I plan to work on improving my SQL.

After graduating, I am still in GA’s outcome program. This allows for continued job hunting support given we meet minimum requirements of 10 job related actions per week and at least 25 hours spent on job hunting or continued professional development. Overall, I am quite pleased with the continued support and the lessons I’ve learnt through the course from the outcome sessions.

### Final Remarks

Overall, GA's DSI course has been an an amazing experience. If you are considering taking this course, you need to make your own decisions based on your financial situation and professional goals.
