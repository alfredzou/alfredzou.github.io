### Introduction

A little over a month ago, I participated in my first hackathon. Initially I was apprehensive, but under the recommendation from my boot camp's career coach, I decided to give it a shot. After all, what's the worst that could happen? Due to the non-committal nature of hackthons, there's nothings stopping me or any of the other participants from dropping out. 

On reflection, I'm happy I decided to participate in Here Technologies' HackForBetterDays hackathon. Regardless of the outcome, I'm happy with what our team managed to achieve, and the lessons learnt and experiences I've gained throughout the hack. If you're considering joining a hackathon, or interested in what a hackathon entails, I've written this post for you.

I've split this post into two main sections:
* Lessons learnt from the hack, and
* A deep dive into the HackForBetterDays hackathon [here](https://alfredzou.github.io/posts/2020/06/HackForBetterDays-Hackathon/). In this section, I give an introduction to the hack, our team's approach and how we spent our time over the one month.

### Lessons Learnt
Lessons learnt from a month long virtual hackathon with a team of 5. The aim was to build an app to address some sort of issue caused by COVID-19 with a location based component. I'm sure these ideas can be extrapolated to different types of hackathons.

#### What is a hackathon
A hackathon is a timed competition where teams compete with each other for prizes. They often involve developing an app to solve some sort of social issue, whilst using the organiser's products. After developing the app, teams then pitch the concept to judges following the judging criteria.

#### The ideal team
Team formation is crucial in having a successful hackathon experience. I think the ideal team is balanced, diverse and small.

##### Balanced
Hackathons essentially have two expected outputs: a working prototype and a pitch to sell it. A team full of developers and you'll have trouble selling your app. A team without developers and you'll have nothing to sell. Essentially, a balanced team of technical and non-technical people are required. If you're a non-technical person whose apprehensive about joining, I encourage you to give a shot.

I think the ideal team looks something like this:
* Hacker: In charge of app development and UX design
* Hustler: In charge of pitching and finer details
* Hacker & Hustler: In charge of ideation and big picture

This may seem familiar, as it is a modified version of 'the Dream Team': Hipsters, who are in charge of UX design, hackers and hustlers

I think the ideal strategy starts with the ideation phase, where everyone agrees on the general app idea, the functionalities, the target users, etc. Then the hackers will focus on app design, including UX. It's hard for hipsters to know the technical capabilities of the hackers. Giving hackers complete control of the app and UX design, will streamline the development process, as they known their technical capabilities the best. In the meantime, the hustlers will focus on the pitch, which includes greater research into the impact, competitors, scalability, etc. of the app.

##### Diverse and small
During the ideation phase, it's extremely difficult in coming up with an app idea. Picking an app idea that not only fits the theme, uses the organiser's products, and is unique or can improve on an existing app, is extremely difficult. This is where diversity comes into play. By leveraging the unique backgrounds and experiences of each team member, a lot more ideas can be brainstormed and evaluated. I believe no matter who you are, everyone has something valuable they can bring to the table.

Additionally, I think a small team size between 4 to 6 is ideal because it's easier to get everyone engaged. Team engagement is important because...

#### Keep your team members engaged
As previously mentioned, hackathons are non-committal. That means at any given time, one of your members could drop out, which could ruin your entire hack. There is no monetary incentive for participants, or a manager who you can complain to. Therefore, it's extremely important to keep your team members engaged in the hack. 

Here are my recommendations on keeping your team engaged:
* Going through an extremely rigorous ideation process, so that all members are happy to proceed with the chosen app idea. I'm sure that everyone can empathise with working on a project they didn't believe in. Keep in mind that your team members are sacrificing their free time, on top of any work or study obligations, to participate in the hack.
* Communication is key. Meetings are extremely important in keeping everyone in the loop. At the end of each meeting, it's important to organise the next meeting and agree on the meeting actions. It's especially crucial for hackers to showcase their progress to other hustlers. This is to ensure the app follows the team's vision and so the hustlers can base their pitch off the app. Additionally, if anything affects your ability to continue your hack, it's best to let your team know as soon as possible, so they can accommodate.
* Commit. Hackathons are tough and a lot of work. However, I think you owe it to your team to see it through.

#### Focus on user centered design
At the end of the day, your app will be used by some sort of end user. User centered design starts from the users, tries to understand them and identifies the problem they face. Then we consider app ideas that could reduce or eliminate these problems. It's an iterative process where we continuously evaluate our app against the users' problems.We should be constantly asking 'Will people use this app?' and 'Why would people use this app over competitors?'. This guarantees that our app is impactful and doesn't just die on the shelf.

Although it's fun, my recommendation to hackers is not to start from the technology. It's cool to be able to implement face mask detection or bluetooth contact tracing. There's a merit of being able to do something, but if an app has no users, it's essentially pointless as an app. What's the actual impact of face mask detection and how is going to be used. What's the point of bluetooth contact tracing if it's the role of governments to develop these things.

#### Build a minimal viable product
On the technical side, the aim is not to develop a fully functional and polished product. The aim is to develop a prototype that can be used during the pitch, or a minimal viable product. I think the judges care more about the pitch, idea, impact, etc. rather than prototype. However, demonstrating a working prototype helps a lot to explain your app and also in showing them its feasible. 

There were some features our team wanted to implement. However during development we realised, we didn't have the technical capability to implement these features, which resulted in a bare bones final product.

#### Final remarks
Although hackathons are a lot of work, it was a really enjoyable experience. The autonomy from choosing a project and working end-to-end on it, is unique and can't be normally experienced from working for a company. Unless maybe its a startup. I also enjoyed wearing multiple hats through ideation, UX design, development, pitching and video editing.
