## Introduction
Two-months ago, I participated in my first hackathon. Initially I was apprehensive, but under the encouragement from my boot camp's career coach, I decided to give it a shot. After all, what's the worst that could happen? Due to the voluntary nature of hackthons, there's nothings stopping me from having a look and dropping out if I didn't like it. 

On reflection, I'm happy I decided to participate in Here Technologies' HackForBetterDays hackathon. Regardless of the outcome, I'm happy with what our team has managed to achieve, and the lessons learnt from the hack. If you're considering joining a hackathon, or are interested in what a hackathon entails, I've written this post for you.

## Lessons Learnt
Lessons learnt from a month-long virtual hackathon with a team of 4 strangers. The aim was to build an app to address some sort of issue caused by COVID-19 with a location-based component. I'm sure these lessons can be extrapolated to other types of hackathons.

### What is a hackathon?
A hackathon is a timed competition where teams compete with each other for prizes. They often involve developing an app to solve some sort of social issue, with a requirement of using the organiser's products. After developing an app, teams then pitch the concept to judges, by following a judging criteria.

### The ideal team
Team formation is crucial in having a successful hackathon experience. I think the ideal team is balanced, diverse and small.

#### Balanced
Hackathons essentially have two expected outputs: a working prototype and a pitch to sell it. A team full of developers and you'll have trouble selling your app. A team without developers and you'll have nothing to sell. Essentially, a balanced team of technical and non-technical people are required. If you're a non-technical person who's apprehensive about joining, I encourage you to give a shot.

I think the ideal team looks something like this:
* Hacker: In charge of app development and UX design
* Hustler: In charge of pitching and finer details
* Hacker & Hustler: In charge of ideation and big picture

This may seem familiar, as it is a modified version of the popular 'Dream Team': Hipsters, who are in charge of UX design, hackers and hustlers

I think the ideal strategy starts with the ideation phase, where everyone agrees on the general app idea, the functionalities, the target users, or the big picture. Then the hackers will focus on app design, including UX. It's hard for hipsters to know the technical capabilities of the hackers. Giving hackers complete control of the app and UX design, will streamline the development process, as only they known their own technical capabilities. In the meantime, the hustlers will focus on the pitch, which includes greater research into the impact, competitors, scalability, or the finer details surrounding the app.

#### Diverse and small
During the ideation phase, it's extremely difficult to brainstorm quality app idea. Picking an idea that not only fits the theme, uses the organiser's products, and is unique or can improve on an existing app, is extremely difficult. This is where diversity comes into play. By leveraging the unique backgrounds and experiences of each team member, a more diverse range of ideas can be brainstormed and evaluated. I believe everyone has something valuable they can bring to the table.

Additionally, I think a small team size between 4 to 6 is ideal because it's easier to get everyone engaged. Team engagement is important because...

### Keep your team members engaged
As previously mentioned, hackathons are non-committal. That means at any given time, one of your members could drop out, which could ruin your entire hack. There is no monetary incentive for participation, or a manager who you can complain to. Therefore, it's extremely important to keep your team members engaged in the hack. 

Here are my recommendations on keeping your team engaged:
* Going through an extremely rigorous ideation process, so that all members are happy to proceed with the chosen app idea. I'm sure that everyone can empathise with working on a project they didn't believe in. Now imagine you've had a hard day at work and you don't really agree with the direction of the app. Do you still want to spend your precious free time on the hack?
* Communication is key. An unresponsive member or being left behind are both bad experiences that can be caused by lack of communication. Hate meetings if you want to, but there's no denying they are effective for keeping everyone in the loop. At the end of each meeting, it's important to organise the next meeting and agree on the meeting actions. It's especially crucial for hackers to showcase their progress to other hustlers. This is to ensure the app follows the team's vision and so the hustlers can base their pitch off the app. Additionally, if anything affects your ability to continue your hack, it's best to let your team know as soon as possible, so they can accommodate.
* Share the work around and value everyone's contribution. In the ideal scenario everyone is doing an equal share of the work. However in reality, there's often people who contribute a lot more and a lot less in a team setting. In both of these cases they can be a bad experience. For the former, you maybe swamped with too much to do, so try to delegate as much work as you can. For the latter, you might not be happy with your level of contribution, but I'm sure your team appreciates anything you can contribute. Delegating all things related to the pitch, helped me keep my sanity during the app development.

### Focus on user centred design
At the end of the day, your app will be used by some sort of end user. User centered design starts from the users, tries to understand them and identifies the problem they face. Then we consider app ideas that could reduce or eliminate these problems. It's an iterative process where we continuously evaluate our app against the users' problems. We should be constantly asking 'Will people use this app?' and 'Why would people use this app over competitors?'. This guarantees that our app is impactful on launch and doesn't just die on the shelf.

Although it's fun, my recommendation to hackers is not to start from the technology. It's cool to be able to implement face mask detection or bluetooth contact tracing. There's merit of being able to do something, but if an app has no users, in terms of an app it's a failure. What's the actual impact of face mask detection and how is going to be used? What's the point of bluetooth contact tracing, if it's the role of governments to develop these things?

### Build a minimal viable product
On the technical side, the aim is not to develop a fully functional and polished product. The aim is to develop a prototype that can be used during the pitch, or a minimal viable product. I think the judges care more about the pitch, idea, impact, etc. rather than the prototype. However, demonstrating a working prototype helps a lot to explain your app, as well as showing the judges it's feasible. Furthermore, we weren't asked to submit our code.

During the initial discussions, we spent a lot of time trying to determine the features we wanted to implement. However during development, we realised they weren't feasible given our technical capabilities and the time constraints. I recommend developing a really simple working prototype, and if time permits, you can think about extending the functionality.

Consider carefully what sort of tech stack you want to use. This is a major decision point, which can be extremely costly to change later on. Due to our lack of app development experience, we decided to use OutSystems, which is a low code solution. It's a heavily GUI driven app development tool with builtin database integration and its easy to test your app in your desktop browser. Overall, I'm really happy with our decision and we couldn't have done it without OutSystems.

## Hacks are hard and time consuming
Now that I've given some recommendations on how to succeed in a hackathon, I want to tell you why you should not take part in a hack.

Firstly, your experiences in the hack will be largely dependent on your team and the team dynamics. There might be some sort of ability to choose your team members, but you can only really find out the team dynamics by working with them. For all the benefits of team work, there will also be times of frustration and disagreement. Although if you dislike or are bad with working with others, it might be a good opportunity to practice your teamwork skills.

Second, hacks are an extremely large time and emotional commitment. Keep in mind that participating in a hack, means sacrificing your free time you could be enjoying yourself or pursing something else. If you're not committed to spend that much time or emotional willpower, I recommend not attending a hack. I want to recount my personal experiences, which demonstrate the time and emotional commitment.

The hack definitely had its up and downs for me. For the first two weeks we spent that on ideation, meeting up on zoom every 2-3 days for 2-3 hours each meeting, to discuss and evaluate app ideas. On top of that, I was extremely frustrated that we couldn't come up with a good idea that everyone was onboard with. That was definitely one of the lowest points of the hack. The frequency of meetings and our lack of progress which was extremely emotionally draining. 

In the last week and a half, we started app development. The two of us being me a data scientist graduate, fresh from a 3-month boot camp, and a mechatronics/CS university student, both of us who had no app development experience. Fortunately, due to our personal circumstances we had a lot of free time, and also the tenacity to see the project through. During this period, we each spent roughly 5-8 hours a day on development. Furthermore, with the past efforts of my team riding on my back and a looming deadline, I was stressed. There was so much to do as well, I couldn't sleep because I was restless, planning what to do the next day while lying in bed. I distinctively remember it feeling like hell. However in reflection, I look back on the memory fondly, as a time we suffered, tried very hard and managed to do something incredible.

At the end of it, we were just glad it was over and done with. We were definitely burnt out. I talk about these experiences because I think mental health is important to talk about, and I want you to know what you're getting in to.

## Final remarks
Overall, it was a really enjoyable experience, specifically the autonomy and the variety of roles. The autonomy from choosing a project and working end-to-end on it, is unique and can't be normally experienced when working for a company. I also enjoyed wearing multiple hats throughout the hack, including ideation, UX design, development, pitching and video editing. However, I'm not too sure I would do it again given the massive time commitment, which lead to burnout.

If you've read to this point, thank you so much. Let me know if you have any questions regarding hackathons or my experiences.
