My name is **Alfred**. I am a data scientist graduate from General Assembly with a background in engineering. To realise my passion for strategic planning, I made the leap into the field of data. I want to help businesses make smart well-informed decisions by understanding their products and customers.

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I hope to showcase some **cool** data projects. My projects currently include a **COVID-19 dashboard** that compares each countries' active cases with their hospital capacity, represented by ICU beds; **web scraping Indeed** to determine the role responsibilities between data engineer, analyst, scientist and business analyst.

I am currently looking for a junior data analyst position at the moment. If you are interested in me or my projects, I would love to chat.
