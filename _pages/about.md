I am a Data Science graduate from General Assembly with a background in engineering. To realise my passion for strategic planning, I made the leap into the field of data. I want to help businesses make smart, well-informed decisions by understanding their products and customers.

At this 3-month boot camp, I learnt a lot about data analytics and science. Although my initial aim was to learn about data analytics, I feel in love with machine learning too. Machine learning can have amazing applications in recommendation systems (think Spotify) and machine translation. Personally, I'm a big fan of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). [You can read about my experiences at GA here.](https://alfredzou.github.io/posts/2020/04/General-Assembly-Data-Science-Immersive/)

## Data Projects
I hope to showcase some **cool data projects**:

* [COVID-19 dashboard](https://alfredzou.github.io/portfolio/COVID-19/) that compares each countries' active cases with their hospital capacity, represented by ICU beds
* [Web scraping Indeed](https://alfredzou.github.io/portfolio/Web%20Scraping%20Indeed/) to determine the different responsibilities between data engineer, analyst, scientist and business analyst.

I am currently looking for a junior data analyst / scientist position at the moment. If you are interested in me or my projects, I would love to chat.
