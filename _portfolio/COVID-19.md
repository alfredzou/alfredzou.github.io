### General Findings
#### Act Early
* At the start of a pandemic there are a lot of questions regarding if government actions are an overreaction
* However, there is 
* This usually leads to blame on governments for taking action too slowly

#### Number of Cases
* Its very difficult to determine the true number of cases
* 


#### Flattern the Curve
* There are two possible types of pandemics: a tall one and a short one. 
* There is also a horizontal line representing the total hospital capacity
* Flattening the curve means taking preventative measures to slow down the spread
* These could be government policies such as testing and lockdowns 
* Or hand washing, social distancing, remote work and reducing unnecessary trips
* Essentially squishing the tall curve below the hospital capacity line, relieving pressure off our medical system

* Approximately 5% of total COVID-19 cases are severe which require an ICU bed and a ventilator
