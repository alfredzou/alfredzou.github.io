### Aim
In my opinion, data is an emerging field that has been gaining poplarity due to a few main factors: firstly the amount of data in the eco system has been greatly increased by the advent of the internet; second, the advancements in computing power has made data much easier to process, especially making machine learning through deep neural networks feasible; finally, the realisation of companies of the power of data either for data analytics or machine learning through data science.

Due to the relatively new nature of the data field, data job positions haven't been concretely defined. To me there are a few stand out divisions. Namely `data engineer`, `data analyst`, `data scientist` and `business analyst`. To test this theory, I want to scrape these roles from Indeed and try see if I can differentiate them based on skills, requirements, salary, etc.

### Developing a robust web scraper
Writing a web scraper can be an extremely frustrating thing, as they must be specifically tailored to the website and will break if the website's architecture changes.
